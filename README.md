  cli53 is a command-line tool for managing Amazon Route 53 DNS, making it easy to import and export zones in BIND format, create and manage hosted zones, and add, update, or delete DNS recordsâ€”including advanced types like failover, latency-based, weighted, geolocation, and ALIAS records. It also supports reusable delegation sets and integrates with AWS profiles and role-based authentication, enabling streamlined automation, migration, and reliable DNS management directly from the terminal.
